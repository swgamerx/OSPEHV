# O.S.P.E.H.V - Open Source Planetary Exploration &amp; Habitation Vehicle - Open Source

An open source project to conceptualize, design, engineer, and possibly manufacture a vehicle for long term ground exploration of planets and other physical bodies in space. 

## Goals
### Human Crew
#### Determine how many people the vehicle needs to support
A manned vehicle will need a minimum crew requirement which must first be determined in order to engineer a vehicle which can support this crew. Things that influence crew requirement. 

#### Psychology of isolation and cooperation
Find and analyze studies performed by scientists to determine how humans perform in isolation as well as in small confined groups for extended periods time. Determine if these studies give any insight into how many people are needed, as well as physical space in order to survive in physical isolation, possibly even communication isolation for months to years at a time. 

Use the findings of these studies to formulate experiments to aid in the determination of crew size requirements. 

#### Division of labor within a crew size tolerence 

Once a crew size is determined, figure out how best to determine the division of labor among the crew as well as specializations that the crew might have to have such as; 

* Engineering
* Geography
* Medicine

#### Determine best way of feeding crew
Research how best to feed the crew, If food should be stored or grown within the vehicle.
